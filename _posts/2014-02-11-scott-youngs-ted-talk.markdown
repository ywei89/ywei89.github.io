[Can you get an MIT education for $2,000? ](http://youtu.be/piSLobJfZ3c)

He chose business major but has a strong personal interest in Computer Science. After finishing the college education, he strongly wanted to learn computer science, but going back to school is not the option, because it's expensive and time-consuming. **He just wanted the education, not the school.**

The distinction between learning and going to school is depicted by his '5-star restaurant' analogy: **you get a complex of multi-facet experience,** including networking with your peers, research opportunities, credentials from the prestigious institution, etc. from the school and pay a big bill for it.

What mattered most for him, is to understand the big ideas of Computer Science, and to be able to implement these ideas into computer programs; simply the education, as he put. So he made his goals to **pass exams and program projects as every MIT will do, but only with the materials available freely on-line.** And he adapts the curriculum of the 4-year CS bachelor program of 32 courses. The only cost is some textbooks so that he can get the whole education for under $2,000.

MIT is notoriously difficult, and not getting the help from faculty seems to make it more challenging.  However, he doubts the the difficulty and argues that **it could be just conventional** because when he was at the school he seldom got that kind of help (sitting in a lecture hall with 300 other students, hardly to get noticed by the lecturer...), and when he started carrying out self-learning he discovered that he could learn much more in this way than in the class room.

Why is self-learning so efficient, and how did he make it? First of all, **boosting personal productivity with time log.** It can help increases time utilization. With the time log, he discovered much time get wasted in school. The wasted time should be used to generate new insights and to remember new facts, which are what learning is about.

Second, **watching video lectures played at 1.5x of the speed,** and sequentially, so that he can cover a lecture that usually takes 4 months in 2 days of real time.

Third, for assignments, doing one question and looking at its answer a time. This creates a **tight feedback loop that facilitates learning.**

In his TED talk, Scott Young did not only introduce his methodology outlined above, but also talked about education in general. "Being able to teach yourself **complex skills and big ideas** is going to be essential to staying ahead."
