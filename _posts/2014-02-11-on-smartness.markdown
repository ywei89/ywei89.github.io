*"What is smartness?"*

I asked the question 1 year ago. During the past a few months, at least one answer has been found. And it was during a trip to the Northwest China.

Upon entering the downtown of Xi Ning after a few hours' ride, off the car I rushed into a dark, dusty and small shop where you could easily got expired food by mistake.

Just as I stepped out of the shop, I realised I could go to the convenience store affiliated to the gas station instead, which was obviously better managed. But it was too late.

Smart people like one of my supervisors, are inclined to search for a better alternative before heading for something. But how do they manage to do that? In addition to do a quick analysis, creativity/imagination is also applied.

If I enumerated available choices, though I could not include a CVS I hadn't yet seen, somehow the fact that we stopped by a gas station and the common sense that there is almost always a CVS in a gas station would eventually guide me to fill in the blank.

And I wouldn't risk buying expired beverages.
